### How it works
* First the code checks if the file path where Google Chrome is installed exists
* Then a command is run that will determine what version of chrome is running
* If you version of chrome is 117 it will let you know if your application is up to date
* If your version of chrome is 115-116 you will be alerted that your application is out of date and instructions will be provided on how to update chrome
* If your version of chrome is 112-114 you will be alerted that your application is out of date, instructions will be provided on how to update chrome, and a list of your current vulnerabilites will be provided
